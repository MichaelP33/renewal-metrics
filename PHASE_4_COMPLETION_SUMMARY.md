  - 0 failures, 0 lint errors

- **Testing Stack:**
  - React Testing Library
  - Jest with jsdom environment
  - @testing-library/user-event
  - @testing-library/jest-dom

### 6. Documentation
- **Updates Made:**

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test  # Verify all 49 tests pass
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev --port 3001`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/power-users`
3. Upload sample CSVs from `power user metrics/` directory
4. Test features:
   - Click any row in Master Table → Drawer opens
   - Press `/` → Search input focuses
   - Press `?` → Shortcuts dialog opens
   - Press `Esc` → Dialogs close
   - Tab through table rows → Focus visible
   - Press Enter on focused row → Drawer opens

### Performance Testing
1. Upload all 3 CSV files (2,600+ users)
2. Apply filters → Response < 200ms
3. Sort by any column → Response < 100ms
4. Type in search → Debounced at 300ms
5. Navigate pages → Instant response

## Known Limitations

1. **Virtualization:** Initially planned but removed due to react-window v2 API complexity. Pagination (50 rows) provides adequate performance.
2. **Browser Support:** Tested on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). IE11 not supported.
3. **Data Size:** Optimized for up to 5,000 users. Larger datasets may require server-side processing.

## Handoff to Phase 5

Phase 4 provides a solid foundation for Phase 5 advanced analytics:

- ✅ All UI components tested and accessible
- ✅ Context provides clean `masterUsers` data
- ✅ Performance optimized for large datasets
- ✅ Extensible component architecture

**Ready for Phase 5 features:**
- User segmentation
- Engagement scoring
- Trend analysis
- Feature adoption patterns
- Advanced visualizations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Testing:** Component testing with React Testing Library caught several edge cases early
2. **Accessibility:** Adding ARIA labels from the start saved refactoring time
3. **Performance:** Memoization and debouncing were critical for 2,600+ row tables
4. **Documentation:** Inline code comments helped with debugging and handoff
