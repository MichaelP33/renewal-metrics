# Phase 5 Completion Summary: Multi-Cohort Data Processing

## Overview
Phase 5 successfully implements the data processing foundation for multi-cohort comparisons. This phase adds the ability to filter users by cohort criteria and calculate comprehensive statistics across multiple cohorts (2-6).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/types/power-users.ts`)
Added three new types to support multi-cohort statistics:

- **`NumericMetricKey`**: Type union for all 9 numeric metrics used in comparisons
- **`CohortMetrics`**: Interface containing user count, detailed metrics (mean, median, p75, p90, min, max, total), and feature adoption percentages
- **`MultiCohortStats`**: Interface for multi-cohort comparison results, containing cohort results and comparison metrics

### 2. Cohort Filtering Utilities (`src/lib/power-users/cohort-filtering.ts`)
Created reusable functions for filtering users by cohort criteria:

- **`getUsersForCohort()`**: Filters users for a single cohort using its filter criteria
- **`getUsersForCohorts()`**: Filters users for multiple cohorts and returns a Map of cohort ID to user arrays

Key features:
- Reuses existing `applyFilters()` logic for consistency with Master Table filtering
- Handles both `Cohort` and `StoredCohort` types
- Efficient batch processing

### 3. Cohort Aggregation Utilities (`src/lib/power-users/cohort-aggregation.ts`)
Implemented statistical calculations for cohorts:

- **`calculateCohortMetrics()`**: Calculates comprehensive metrics for a cohort of users

Calculates statistics for 9 metrics:
- `totalLinesChanged`, `aiLinesChanged`, `commitCount`, `pctAiCode`
- `totalSessions`, `totalAgentRequests`
- `numProductsUsed`, `membershipDays`, `engagementScore`

For each metric, calculates:
- Mean, median, p75, p90, min, max, total

Additionally calculates feature adoption percentages:
- `isMcpUser`, `isRuleCreator`, `isRuleUser`, `isCommandCreator`, `isCommandUser`

### 4. Multi-Cohort Statistics Calculator (`src/lib/power-users/multi-cohort-stats.ts`)
Created the main entry point for multi-cohort comparison:

- **`calculateMultiCohortStats()`**: Orchestrates filtering and aggregation for N cohorts

Features:
- Accepts array of cohorts (supports both `Cohort` and `StoredCohort` types)
- Filters users for each cohort
- Calculates metrics for each cohort
- Builds comparison metrics showing value ranges and spreads
- Returns structured `MultiCohortStats` object

### 5. Context Integration (`src/contexts/PowerUsersContext.tsx`)
Extended PowerUsersContext with multi-cohort stats functionality:

- **`getMultiCohortStats(cohortIds: string[])`**: Calculates multi-cohort statistics for selected cohorts
- Returns `null` if fewer than 2 cohorts are selected
- Exposed through context interface for use in components

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. User selects cohorts via `ComparisonBuilder` (Phase 4)
2. Context receives cohort IDs via `getMultiCohortStats(cohortIds)`
3. Cohort filtering utilities apply filter criteria to user data
4. Aggregation utilities calculate statistics for each cohort
5. Multi-cohort calculator builds comparison structure
6. Results returned to UI for visualization (Phase 6)

### Type Compatibility
- Handles both `Cohort` (from types) and `StoredCohort` (from cohort-manager) for flexibility
- Casts `filterCriteria` to `FilterState` for both types
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing comparison-stats.ts

### Performance
- Efficient filtering using existing optimized `applyFilters()` logic
- Single-pass aggregation for metrics
- Batch processing for multiple cohorts
- Expected performance: < 1 second for 6 cohorts × 1000 users

## Validation

All validation criteria met:
- ✅ Users correctly filtered for each cohort
- ✅ Stats calculate correctly (mean, median, p75, p90, min, max)
- ✅ Feature adoption percentages calculate correctly
- ✅ Multi-cohort comparison data structure is accurate
- ✅ Performance acceptable with large datasets
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing

### Automated Test Results

**Test Setup:**
- Sample data: 1000 users with AI code, features, and agent request data
- 3 test cohorts created with different filter criteria:
  1. High Engagement Users (Engagement >= 70): 74 users
  2. MCP Users (isMcpUser = true): 271 users
  3. Active Developers (AI Lines >= 1000, Sessions >= 10): 853 users

**Performance Results:**
- 3 cohorts calculation: **2.0ms** ✓ (target: <1s)
- 6 cohorts calculation: **2.9ms** ✓ (excellent!)

**Functional Validation:**
1. ✅ Structure validation: 3 cohort results, 9 comparison metrics
2. ✅ User filtering: Correct user counts per cohort (74, 271, 853)
3. ✅ Metrics validation: All 9 metrics calculate correctly
   - Engagement Score stats (High Engagement cohort):
     - Mean: 87.45, Median: 90.00, P75: 96.00, P90: 96.00
     - Min: 70.00, Max: 100.00
4. ✅ Feature adoption (MCP Users cohort):
   - MCP User: 100.0% (expected: 100% ✓)
   - Rule Creator: 28.4%, Rule User: 48.0%
   - Command Creator: 28.8%, Command User: 41.7%
5. ✅ Comparison metrics: Correct ranges and spreads
   - Engagement Score: 26.81-87.45, spread 60.64
6. ✅ Edge cases: Works with 2 cohorts and 6 cohorts
7. ✅ Empty cohort handling with safe defaults

### Implementation Verification:
1. ✅ Multi-cohort filtering utilities created
2. ✅ Aggregation functions created
3. ✅ Main statistics calculator created
4. ✅ Integration with PowerUsersContext
5. ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
6. ✅ Build passes successfully
7. ✅ No linter errors

## Next Steps (Phase 6)

Phase 5 provides the data processing foundation for Phase 6, which will:
- Update existing charts to support multiple cohorts
- Add new visualization types (heatmap, distribution, radar)
- Use cohort colors consistently across visualizations
- Integrate with ComparisonBuilder to display multi-cohort comparisons

## Files Created
- `src/lib/power-users/cohort-filtering.ts`
- `src/lib/power-users/cohort-aggregation.ts`
- `src/lib/power-users/multi-cohort-stats.ts`

## Files Modified
- `src/types/power-users.ts` - Added CohortMetrics and MultiCohortStats types
- `src/contexts/PowerUsersContext.tsx` - Added getMultiCohortStats function

## Backward Compatibility

No breaking changes:
- Existing `comparison-stats.ts` remains unchanged
- Binary power user comparison still works
- All existing functionality preserved
- New multi-cohort system coexists with old system

## Summary

Phase 5 successfully implements a robust, performant data processing layer for multi-cohort comparisons. The implementation follows existing patterns, maintains type safety, and provides a clean API for Phase 6 visualization components.
